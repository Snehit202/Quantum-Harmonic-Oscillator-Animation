# Quantum-Harmonic-Oscillator-Animation
The repository contains python codes for animation of the time evolution of a gaussian wave function in a harmonic potential well. The time-evolution is calculated both in Heisenberg picture and Schrodinger picture of Quantum mechanics.

Requirements for the code tomake the animation:
1. ffmpeg software in addition to standard python packages numpy andmatplotlib
2. Tested to run on python version > 3.10
